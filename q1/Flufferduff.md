# Flufferduff - 20

##Problem
We here at sCTF enjoy weird words.

Let *(n) = d(n) - x(n) where x(n) is the sum of all odd numbers above 0 and before n, exclusive, and d(n) is the sum of all primes in the range of (0,n), exclusive.

When *(n) is negative, we call this a flufferduff.

Find the number of flufferduffs below 1000.
