# Hello World - 25

##Problem
>The flag is less than 8 characters.

>Have Fun

>NOTE: You don't have to run the problem to solve, and it isn't advised either.

##Solution

The program was decompiled and ran through several IDAs to attempt to figure out its purpose, which after a bit of digging was to shut-down Windows. After the multiple people complained about BSOD the admins posted a note to the problem (seen above). One was to guess the name of the program into the submit box.

##Flag

>qwerty
